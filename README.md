# News Research Tool ðŸ“ˆ

This project utilizes LangChain and the Gemini API to create a tool for researching news articles. Users can input URLs of news articles, and the tool will process and extract information to answer user queries based on the content of the articles.

## Overview

Users can input up to three URLs of news articles. The tool processes these articles, generates embeddings using the Gemini API, and stores them in a FAISS index. Users can then input questions, and the tool will retrieve and provide answers based on the content of the articles.

## Features

- **URL Input**: Users can input up to three URLs of news articles.
- **Data Processing**: The tool processes and splits the text from the articles.
- **Embeddings Generation**: Generates embeddings using the Gemini API and stores them in a FAISS index.
- **Question Answering**: Users can ask questions, and the tool retrieves answers based on the processed articles.
